Missing Data
  I found it very difficult to find stock market data on a small enough timeframe. For this reason I decided to work with data on a daily timeframe. Generalization can be an issue because of the limited amount of samples. In order to ensure this isn't and issue, noise will be added to the data so this can be fed to the model multiple times to ensure generalization and conversion.
